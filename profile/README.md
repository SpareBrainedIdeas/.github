## Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central API v2.0 Reference
This book is meant to be not only an introduction but a powerful companion to the official documentation for anyone who has a need to rely on the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central API v2.0.

This book is meant for two main audiences:

### Business Central Users and Advocates

If you are a user, consultant, or developer working with Business Central, this book is hopefully useful to you as a guide to what parts of the system are accessible via API. Ideally, it will also make it easier to understand what each part of the API maps to the inside of Business Central.

### Non-Business Central Developers

If you are a developer or organization that has been tasked with integrating with or building against the Business Central API, this book will help you understand what the options are in a single, unified place. It will also help you communicate more effectively with Business Central users about what you are creating.
- I also recorded a podcast about the book here:
